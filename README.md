This data set is a collection of golf scores over the past 15 years from an annual golf tournament that has been going on since the 1980s. The event takes place every fall on the Canadian shores of Lake Erie. Family and friends gather at this annual golf tournament coming from all over the country. The golf, perhaps once the reason for the gather, is simply now an excuse for old friends to see each other and discuss all sorts of topics over the course of the weekend. The conversations, beverages, stories and laughs around the fire place, a stones throw away from the cold waters of Lake Erie are fantastic - the golf, not so much. After the tournament concludes on Saturday, the scores get recorded into a "TPO Database" - an excel file created by one of the founding members. Most of the scores are wished to be forgotten by the golfers, but to their dismay, there is now a fantastic database of scores that is ripe for insights.
